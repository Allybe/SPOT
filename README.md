# SPOT
SPOT (Scouting Platforms On Time) is an open source modular scouting app framework developed by Team 3061 Huskie Robotics. SPOT provides a simple platform upon which a team can build a scouting app with little to no prior experience.
* Quick setup with a built-in first-run wizard to walk teams through configuring their scouting app, connecting to The Blue Alliance, and setting up their database.

## SPOT Is Teams Who...

2. Teams that have some experience with scouting and wants to collect specific data that may not be part of the default configuration but that doesn't have significant programming experience. SPOT can be configured by modifying configuration files rather than by writing code.
3. Teams that have experience with scouting and wants to perform custom analysis operations or advanced custom scouting interfaces and has some programming experience. SPOT can utilize user-provided analysis modules to extend its functionary beyond the default configuration without requiring teams to modify the base code. 
4. Teams that have significant experience with scouting and significant programming expertise. SPOT is open source, document, and designed to extensible such that teams can start from this code base and build their own custom scouting system.
